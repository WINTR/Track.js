# Track.js

Google Analytics and Floodlight tracking made a little simpler

## Installation

`bower install track-js --save` **OR** `npm install track-js --save`

## Usage

1. Require Track.js as CommonJS, AMD, or global module. Also, make sure jQuery is around.
2. Add the appropriate data attributes to your links to get things going
3. Initialize the library: `new Track()`

## Data Attributes 

`data-track`: Turns on tracking for the link

### Google Analytics Event Tracking

If any of the following are present on the link, a custom GA event will be sent. 

`data-track-category`: The "category" for the event

`data-track-action`: The "action" for the event

`data-track-label`: The "label" for the event

### Floodlight Tracking

If the following is present for a link, a Floodlight iframe will be appended to the page's body element. The "src" should be the full URL provided ending with "ord=". 

`data-track-floodlight-src` 

## Options

`debug`: Should be `true` or `false`. Will turn on logging of trigged events.

## Develop and Build

Run `gulp` to develop, and/or `gulp build` to create compiled js.
